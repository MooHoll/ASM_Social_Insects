# Allele-Specific DNA Methylation Across Social Insects

Summary here

**Hollie NOTES:**
Currently trying to get GO terms for all species. Brendan Hunt has suggested to use the online GUI called EggNOG which will take a .fa of genes and create GO annoations. So, currently I have made a .fa for genes from all species except L.albipes as it doesn't appear to have gene annoation, only mRNA. So need to take a look at this.

Alternativly, Maarten Reijnders has developed some software called CrowdGO which curates GO annoations from multiple sources/pipelines to create a more accurate annotation. He has offered the files for all species found in UniProt, however this leaves out L.albipes and C.calcarata. I've messaged him to see what he thinks.
